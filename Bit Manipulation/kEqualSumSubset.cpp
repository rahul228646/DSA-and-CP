// The best solution for this problem is definitely bit manipulation DP with complexity O(n2^n). Whereas dfs will render a expotential complexity and it is hard to analyze.

// Here is my idea: We use mask to determine the state, the state will tell you "which numbers are selected already". For example nums = [2,1,4,3,5,6,2], mask = "1100101" , then that means we have already chosen 2,1,5,2.

// Now, how do we consider the conversion between states? Consider the example above, it is clear that we have 4,3,6 unchosen so we can choose any of them. But, as explained in the leetcode official solution, we can't choose a number such that it crosses our target. And dp[mask] will represent sum(chosen number) % target. Hence the state conversion will become:

// dp[mask|(1<<i)] = (dp[mask]+nums[i]) % tar;

// An Example will be: nums = [4, 3, 2, 3, 5, 2, 1], k = 4, tar = 5
// dp["1100101"] represents we have chosen 4,3,5,1, the sum is 4+3+5+1 = 13, 13%5 = 3, hence dp["1100101"] = 3

// If dp["11111...1111"] == 0 then that means we can find the solution.
