// - Get count of the nodes in the first list, let count be c1.
// - Get count of the nodes in the second list, let count be c2.
// - Get the difference of counts d = abs(c1 â€“ c2)
// - Now traverse the bigger list from the first node till d nodes so that from here onwards both the lists have equal no of nodes
//   Then we can traverse both the lists in parallel till we come across a common node. 
//   (Note that getting a common node is done by comparing the address of the nodes)
