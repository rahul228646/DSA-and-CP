I saw many solutions were referring to factors of 2 and 3. But why these two magic numbers? Why other factors do not work?
Let's study the math behind it.

For convenience, say n is sufficiently large and can be broken into any smaller real positive numbers. We now try to calculate which real number generates the largest product.
Assume we break n into (n / x) x's, then the product will be xn/x, and we want to maximize it.

Taking its derivative gives us n * xn/x-2 * (1 - ln(x)).
The derivative is positive when 0 < x < e, and equal to 0 when x = e, then becomes negative when x > e,
which indicates that the product increases as x increases, then reaches its maximum when x = e, then starts dropping.

This reveals the fact that if n is sufficiently large and we are allowed to break n into real numbers,
the best idea is to break it into nearly all e's.
On the other hand, if n is sufficiently large and we can only break n into integers, we should choose integers that are closer to e.
The only potential candidates are 2 and 3 since 2 < e < 3, but we will generally prefer 3 to 2. Why?

Of course, one can prove it based on the formula above, but there is a more natural way shown as follows.

6 = 2 + 2 + 2 = 3 + 3. But 2 * 2 * 2 < 3 * 3.
Therefore, if there are three 2's in the decomposition, we can replace them by two 3's to gain a larger product.

All the analysis above assumes n is significantly large. When n is small (say n <= 10), it may contain flaws.
For instance, when n = 4, we have 2 * 2 > 3 * 1.
To fix it, we keep breaking n into 3's until n gets smaller than 10, then solve the problem by brute-force.
